# Directories of web service instances

This branch contains a static XHTML page with a list of links to directories of web service instances, sorted alphabetically.

To add additional software instance directories to this list, create a merge request for this [branch](https://github.com/PrivateBin/Directory/tree/static-index). In order to qualify being added to the list, the web service directory needs to be [Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS)](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) and it should get updated at least once a week, manually or automatically. The main development branch of this project contains an example of an automated directory list service and the maintainer would be interested to expand it to cover additional web services - [raise an issue per web service type to discuss this further](https://github.com/PrivateBin/Directory/issues/new/choose), if you are interested in participating.
